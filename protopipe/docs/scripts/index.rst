Introduction
============

`protopipe.scripts` contains the following scripts:

 * write_dl1.py (:ref:`pipeline`)
 * write_dl2.py (:ref:`pipeline`)
 * build_model.py (:ref:`mva`)
 * model_diagnostic.py (:ref:`mva`)
 * make_performance.py (:ref:`perf`)
 
that are sufficient to estimate the performance of the instruments
going from DL0 to DL3. In order to process a significant amount of events
with the :ref:`pipeline` scripts the use of the GRID is rapidly
mandatory. Some utility scripts to submits jobs on the GRID are provided on
the `GRID repository <https://drf-gitlab.cea.fr/CTA-Irfu/grid>`_.
