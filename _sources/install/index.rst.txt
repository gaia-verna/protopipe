Installation
============

The only requirement is an Anaconda (or Miniconda) installation which supports
Python 3.

There are two different ways to install `protopipe`,

* if you just want to use it as it is (:ref:`install-release`),
* or if you also want to develop it (:ref:`install-development`).

In both cases, if you want to perform a full analysis, will need some
computational power in order to produce enough
data files for model and performance estimation.
This can be accomplished through the use of a GRID environment.

After installing `protopipe`,

* install the code necessary to interface it with the grid (:ref:`install-grid`),
* use protopipe on the grid (:ref:`use-grid`).
