Development version
===================

  1. `fork <https://help.github.com/en/articles/fork-a-repo>`__ the `repository <https://github.com/cta-observatory/protopipe>`_
  3. ``conda env create -f environment.yml``
  4. ``conda activate protopipe``
  5. ``pip install -e .``

In this way, you will always use the version of the source code on which you
are working.

Next steps:

  * get accustomed to the basic pipeline workflow (:ref:`use-pipeline`),
  * make your own complete analysis (:ref:`use-grid`),
  * for bugs and new features, please contribute to the project (:ref:`contribute`).
